# Writing Articles in the Hylark Knowledge Base üìù

Welcome to your comprehensive guide for crafting and publishing articles in the
Hylark knowledge base using Nova. This guide is designed to streamline your
writing process and ensure your contributions are impactful and accessible.

## Overview üåê

The knowledge base is systematically organized into categories and folders,
facilitating easy navigation and topic grouping. Articles are tagged for quick
searches. User feedback through likes or dislikes, along with view counts, are
available in the Nova dashboard to gauge the impact of your articles.

## Managing Categories üóÇÔ∏è

In the 'Categories' resource within Nova, you'll find a list of all categories
as they appear in the knowledge base. Here's how to manage them effectively:

- **Reordering**: Change the order of categories by clicking and dragging the
ordering icon. Arrange them based on popularity or relevance, with frequently
accessed categories like "Getting Started" at the top.
- **Creating and Editing**: Add new categories or edit existing ones, including
managing folders within the same form.
- **Deleting**: To delete a category, ensure all articles within it are removed
first.

## Folders üìÇ

Folders within categories can also be reorganized for optimal structuring:

- **Management**: Edit or delete folders through the category view. Remember,
folders must be empty of articles before deletion.

## Articles: The Main Event üì∞

Articles are central to the knowledge base. Here‚Äôs how to manage them:

- **Creation**: Start a new article via the folders view or directly in the
articles resource, specifying the appropriate folder.
- **Drafts and Publishing**: Articles initially save as drafts. Use the
'Publish' button to make them live. Hidden articles can result in a 404 error
for users with direct links.
- **Version Control**: Each edit creates a new version. Use 'Restore Version'
for reverts, keeping in mind that only one version is live at any given time.
Older versions are valuable for reference but can be deleted if necessary.
- **What happens if two people edit at once?**: Each edit creates a new draft. Two
people editing at once will create two different drafts. Try to coordinate with other
team members so as not to duplicate work.

> **Note:** If you try to publish a draft that links to non-existent or
> unpublished articles, you will get an error.  
> In a similar way, if you try to hide or delete an article that is linked to
> by other articles, you will get an error.
> **NOTE ON IMAGES** Please ensure that all images and videos have a clear, user-friendly name and a description.

### Topics üè∑Ô∏è

- **Purpose**: Topics aid in article discovery and organization. They're not just for searching but
also feature on the knowledge base's front page to highlight popular topics.
- **Management**: Assign or create new topics within the article editing form or
directly in the topics resource.
- **Use within app**: Topics are user-facing and changes should be evaluated for impact on the app.

### Article Content ‚úçÔ∏è

The rich text editor is your tool for crafting engaging, informative content:

- **Refer to the content-writing guide**: Review the style guide for writing content
on Hylark before you write any content.
- **Formatting**: Utilize headings, lists, and visual aids for clarity.
- **Images**: Upload directly for reliability or link externally if stable.
Always include captions for accessibility.
- **Videos**: Embed from platforms like YouTube or Vimeo using the video play
button in the editor.
- **Internal linking**: Use the article button in the toolbar for internal
links, ensuring link text is descriptive and avoids vague phrases like "click
here". To avoid broken links, only published articles are available for linking. If you want to linking to an article that is not published yet, you will need to publish it first, and then add in the link to it right after.
- **Consistency**: Keep writing style, formatting, etc... consistent. Again, please
refer to the style guide.
- **Impact on app**: Articles are integrated into the Hylark app. Please consider this
when adding or removing content. There are prompts on the site guiding users to certain articles.
If you modify the article, that prompt will lead to nothing. Or, if you add an article, perhaps a
prompt should be added within the app.

Feel free to explore additional editor features and reach out to the development
team for enhancements.
